    "<!--(Just in case you are wondering why you have been asked to return the answer in such a strange form, I'm glad you're questioning that! While this form does seem quite strange at first, let's think about how this function would work in practice. Imagine you are researching a problem in science that involves solving quadratics. Let's say you don't want to use any solutions that appear at any stage that are complex, you only want to work with real solutions. Presumably you'd prefer it if your code was robust enough to not give you an error and kick up a big fuss if it came across a complex number - this would require your attention and you're far too busy for that! Now think about what happens if you only return two numbers in a list from your `get_roots(a,b,c)` function. If we have two real roots, there isn't any problem. However, if they are complex, your computer will have to look at them after they are returned from the `get_roots(a,b,c)` function before it knows this. What we are doing above is returning an extra number (often called a \"flag\") which gives us a way to know whether or not we've got real solutions, without even having to look at the solutions! As we can deal with complex numbers in Python, a flag isn't strictly necessary here, but it is necessary in more complex -->\n",
